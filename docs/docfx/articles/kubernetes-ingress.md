# Kubernetes Ingress Controller

Introduced: 1.0.0

YARP can be integrated with Kubernetes as a reverse proxy managing HTTP/HTTPS traffic ingress to a Kubernetes cluster. Currently, the module is shipped as a separate package and is in preview.

## Get Started

The Kubernetes ingress controller runs as a separate process/pod inside of your Kubernetes cluster.

TODO image vs template. Is there anything someone would want to customize in the controller? Should we just push the controller somewhere?
